Laboratory Exercise 2: MySQL Functions, Group By, Order By and Constraints
This Laboratory involve advance mysql queries and built-in functions such as Group By, Order by and Constraints. The task involving the table creation is pretty straightforward, However as i progress and utilizing functions such as String, Date, Numeric, Group by, and Order by can be a bit challenging. Overall, it was a fun and a good hands-on experience that really enchances my skills, understandings, and the ability to manipulate data in a database.
